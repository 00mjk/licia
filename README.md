# Eris

Eustia official module repository.

## Another Lodash?

No. The goal of Eustia is to provide a huge number of useful and small
JavaScript codes, not just functions, but also modules and classes. Think of it
as a mini version of npm suitable for tiny packages.

## Submitting New Modules

Unable to find one suitable? Fork it on GitHub, add the module and submit a pull
request.

### Rules

* Must have full documentation about usage.
* Must have test.
* Must not be repeated. (e.g. leftPad is not allowed because there is already a
  module called lpad)
